# WNYU Data Management Project

I would like to build an internal data management platform for WNYU, our campus radio station. As the station's current General Manager, it has been glaringly obvious that we lack a central way to organize information.

We maintain decades of dataâ€”including personnel lists of alumni and current staff, lists of past shows and their associated archives, documents, physical and digital media, and much more.

It would be ideal to integrate this with our ongoing archival media digitization efforts. As we have tens of thousands of CDs, LPs, and tapes, it is vital that we have a way to easily log, update, and access our library.

# User Goals

This platform would be a one-stop-shop for any and all data we have. It would allow an admin user to update and add information as necessary. It would be a clean, sophisticated hosted web-app that will be accessible at different user security levels (super-admin, admin, regular staff).

# Scope

This is an ambitious project for a small team, as the goal is a fully functional and persisting system, but we can utilize existing frameworks like MongoDB.
